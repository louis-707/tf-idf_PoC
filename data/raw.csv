EP2811259A1,CONFOCAL MEASUREMENT DEVICE,"A confocal measurement device uses confocal optics to measure a profile of a measurement target (200). The confocal measurement device is provided with a light source, a diffraction lens (1) chromatically distorting light emitted from the light source along the direction of an optical axis, and a measurement unit measuring the intensity at each wavelength of the light within the chromatically distorted light created by the diffraction lens (1) and focused on the measurement target (200). Furthermore, the primary ray (11b) from the light source to the diffraction lens (1) is offset relative to the optical axis (1a) of the diffraction lens (1) in the confocal measurement device."

US10260941B2,Chromatic confocal distance sensor,"A chromatic confocal distance sensor has a housing in which a polychromatic light source, imaging optics having a longitudinal chromatic aberration, a spectrometer and a planar beam splitter surface are arranged. These lie in the light path of the measurement light between the light source and the imaging optics and between the imaging optics and the spectrometer. A first diaphragm is arranged in the light path between the light source and the beam splitter surface, and a second diaphragm is arranged in the light path between the beam splitter surface and the spectrometer. The diaphragms are arranged mirror-symmetrically with respect to the beam splitter surface. The measurement light propagates as a free beam inside the housing. The beam splitter surface, the first diaphragm and the second diaphragm are fastened together on a carrier which has an isotropic thermal expansion coefficient. This way, temperature changes cannot significantly affect the measurement accuracy."
US11231270B2,Optical measuring device,"The optical measuring device includes a light source that outputs light of a plurality of wavelengths; a sensor head including a conversion lens that converts light incident via a light guide part, which includes a plurality of cores, into parallel light, and an objective lens that irradiates the light in which chromatic aberration is generated to a measurement object; and a spectroscope that acquires reflected light reflected by the measurement object and condensed by the sensor head via the light guide part and measures a spectrum of the reflected light. In the sensor head, a shield that shields light is arranged between the conversion lens and the objective lens to inhibit light emitted from one core among the plurality of cores included in the light guide part from entering cores other than the one core as the reflected light."
WO0114837A1, MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER WITH A CALIBRATION DEVICE,"A Michelson interferometer has a beam-splitter which splits a beam provided by a radiation source into two partial beams before reuniting said partial beams once they have completed two radiation paths, for receiving in a detector. Two deviation mirrors reflect the partial beams coming from the beam-splitter into the different partial areas of a rotating retroreflector whose axis of rotation is laterally offset from its triple point. Two plane mirrors reflect back the partial beams reflected by the retroreflector perpendicularly to said retroreflector. A laser beam is guided through the paths of radiation of the interferometer for calibration purposes. According to the invention, said laser beam (25) passes into the paths of radiation of the interferometer through openings (27, 28) in the mirrors (5, 22), and the deviation mirrors (10, 12) are positioned in such a way that they reflect the partial beams (9, 11) through between the two plane mirrors (18, 19), past said plane mirrors and into the retroreflector (14). As a result, the inventive Michelson interferometer has a simple construction."
